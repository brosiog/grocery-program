Hello, this is a simple program I wrote to help you split grocery costs with your roomates. First you enter your roomates names, then you enter each grocery item one by one. 
When adding the item, you input the price of the item, as well as which roomates are willing to split the item. The output is how much each roomate owns, given their split on a per item basis.
This was a very useful tool to use in my undergrad, and saved so much time and so many headaches. I hope you can find it useful as well!
